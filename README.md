# Predicting low birth weight in children
 
Team: Mahrukh Khan, Niyatha Malepati, ByungJun Kim

The project aimed to predict low birth weight in children using publicy available de-identified dataset for Indiana, U.S. We deployed classification models in Python to predict the liklihood of a baby born with low birth weight using mother's characteristics. We find that mothers who had birth complications, diabetes during their pregnancy or gestation period and reported smoking during their pregnancy, had babies with low birth weight.
